<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Alcohol Abuse</h2>
  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30px;"> Alcohol Abuse is something that is seen a lot around the world, a way to drown sorrows when things go wrong, when there is a loss that shatters everything, when the responsibilities become too much to handle. Sometimes, the alcohol is to forget the past, forget what one has gone through, forget everything that has happened, but going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings help provide that comfort to get to the root of the problem. <a href="https://characters.html">Jacquie Red Feather</a>   goes to AA meetings because she could never quite stay sober as long as she hoped, drinking became her crutch that she couldn’t let go of, but she wanted to be able to go back to her family finally. Harvey was an AA meeting leader, and he met Jacquie again at the AA meeting. It wasn’t just Jacquie, but  <a href="https://characters.html">Dene Oxendene as well as Jacquie Red Feather Tony Loneman</a> that dealt with alcohol abuse in other ways. Tony’s mother drank while she was pregnant with him; meanwhile, Dene’s uncle drank himself to death.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Notable Alcohol Abuse Quotations</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;"><ul style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;">
    <li>“When I asked Maxine, she told me my mom drank when I was in her, she told me real slow that I have fetal alcohol syn-drome” (15).</li><br>

    <li>“He’s been drinking too much for too long. His body, his liver’s going.”<br><br>
      “Going? But he just got here,” Dene said, and he saw that this made his mom cry, but only for a second.<br><br>
      She wiped her eyes with the back of her arm and said, “There’s nothing we can do at this point, honey.”<br><br>
      “But why wasn’t something done when it could have been done?”<br><br>
      “There are some things we can’t control, some people we can’t help.”<br><br>
      “He’s your brother.”<br><br>
      “What was I supposed to do, Dene? There was nothing I could have done. He’s been doing this most of his life.”<br><br>
      “Why?”<br><br>
      “I don’t know.”(34-35)</li><br>

    <li>“She’d been sober six months then. The longest since she’d started drinking. But after that she drove straight to the liquor store, spent the next six years stomaching a fifth of whiskey a night. Drank herself into a manageable oblivion every night” (106).</li><br>

    <li>“Getting fucked up seems like the only thing left to do,” Harvey went on. “It’s not the alcohol. There’s not some special relationship between Indians and alcohol. It’s just what’s cheap, available, legal. It’s what we have to go to when it seems like we have nothing else left” (112).</li></ul></p><br>
