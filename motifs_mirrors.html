<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Mirrors and Reflections</h2>
  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30px;">Mirrors and reflections act as a powerful motif throughout <i>There There</i>. Many characters are depicted looking at their own reflections. As Tommy Orange is especially interested in telling untold Native stories, the characters’ relationships with their reflections seem to depict this lack of urban Native representation. Thus, the characters’ struggles with identity appear directly tied to their struggles of not seeing accurate representations of their experiences in history, pop culture, or mainstream stories.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Notable Reflection Quotations</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;"><ul style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;">
    <li>“Back home, in front of the TV, before I turned it on, I saw my face in the dark reflection there. It was the first time I saw it. My own face, the way everyone else saw it” (15).</li><br>

    <li>“Your face in the mirror, reflected back at you, most people don’t even know what it looks like anymore. That thing on the front of your head, you’ll never see it [...] but me, I know what my face looks like. I know what it means” (16).</li><br>

    <li>“[...] just a sudden and mute black screen&mdash;my face reflected in it, staring first in horror at the computer dying, then at my face reacting to seeing my face react to the computer dying. A little part of me died then, seeing my face, thinking about this sick addiction, all this time I’ve spent doing almost nothing” (63).</li><br>

    <li>“Mirrors have always been a problem for him. The word <i>stupid</i> often sounds in his head when he looks at himself in the mirror [...] what Orvil is, according to himself, standing in front of the mirror with his too-small-for-him stolen regalia, is <i>dressed up like an Indian</i> [...] And yet there’s something there [...] which is why he keeps looking, keeps standing in front of the mirror. He’s waiting for something true to appear before him&mdash;about him” (121-122).</li>

    <li>“Every time she gets into her mail truck, Opal does the same thing. She looks into the rearview and finds her gaze looking back at her through the years [...] it’s hard to see the years on her face, the lines and wrinkles that surround her eyes, branch out like cracks in the concrete. But even though she hates to see her face, she’s never been able to stop the habit of looking at it when she finds a mirror there in front of her, where she catches one of the only versions of her face she’ll ever see&mdash;on top of glass” (159).</li></ul></p><br>
