<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;">Motherhood</h2>
  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30px;">Mothers play an important role in <i>There There</i>. Often, we also see that the mothers are single or remarried. Often the grandmothers also play an important role in the lives of children and even young adult characters. This could represent and mean many different things for the book. For instance, this could be reminiscent of the matrilineal societies that many Native peoples belonged to. It can also be a kind homage to the strength of women and their role in keeping families together and children alive in times--sometimes through generations--of great hardships. Mothers, though they are all different, play important roles in all the lives of the main characters.</p>
