<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Music and Dancing</h2>
  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30px;">Indigenous music and dancing are central to <i>There There </i> as a whole, for each is prominent in the Oakland powwow, the climactic event of the novel that brings the characters together. Many of the characters show emotional connection to various kinds of music, but Native music appears to have the greatest impact on their cultural identity and perception of heritage. Specifically,<a href="characters.html">Orvil Red Feather</a> and <a href="characters.html">Thomas Frank</a> each have special connections to dancing and music as it pertains to their identities as Cheyenne people. For Orvil, powwow music and dancing allow him to feel more connected to his indigenous history and traditions that have been largely kept from him. For Thomas, powwow music and drumming appear to act as outlets for the generational pain he feels in response to Native oppression. Thus, Native music and dancing function as symbolic ties to cultural heritage and identity throughout much of the novel.

<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Notable Music and Dancing Quotations</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;"><ul style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;">
    <li>"Orvil mainly listens to powwow music. There's something in the energy of that big booming drum, in the intensity of the singing, like an urgency that feels specifically Indian [...] There was even one time, when he was dancing in Opal's room with his eyes closed, when he felt like it was all his ancestors who made it so he could be there dancing and listening to that sound, singing right there in his ears through all those hard years they made it through" (126).</li><br>

    <li>"High-voiced wailing and howled harmonies that screamed through the boom of that big drum. Old songs that sang to the old sadness you always kept as close as skin without meaning to. The word triumph blipped in your head then [...] This was what it sounded like to make it through these hundreds of American years, to sing through them. This was the sound of pain forgetting itself in song" (212).</li><br>

    <li>"'There's only one way for an Indian man to express himself. It's that dance that comes from all the way back there. All the way over there. You learn that dance to keep it, to use it. Whatever you got going on in your life, you don't leave it all in here [...] you bring it with you, you dance to it'" (231).</li><br>

    <li>"To get to that feeling, to get to that prayer, you have to trick yourself out of thinking altogether. Out of acting. Out of everything. To dance as if time only mattered insofar as you could keep a beat to it, in order to dance in such a way that time itself discontinued, disappeared, ran out [...] your feathers a flutter of echoes centuries old, your whole being a kind of flight. To perform and win you have to dance true" (232-233).</li></ul></p><br>
