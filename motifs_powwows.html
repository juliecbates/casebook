  Common Motifs and Symbols
</h1>

<p style ="align:center;">
<img src="images/powwow.jpg" alt="Powwow Image" style= "max-width:75%; margin-left:50px; border:7px solid #569997"></p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Powwows</h2>
  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30px;">Powwows are where these characters are able to come together at the end of the novel, but it's more symbolic than that. Powwows are where the Native Amerians are all able to come together as a community, dressing up in their regalia, and celebrating their culture. This is also where the characters all come together to meet, and celebrate, but also where the downfall happens that tears through the lives of each of these characters. This is where the characters either are just learning more about their culture, celebrating their culture, finding their parents, or coming to take what doesn't belong to them.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;">Notable Powwow Quotations</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;"><ul style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;">
    <li>"'We dress up Indian, with feathers and beads and shit. We dance. Sing and beat this drum, buy and sell Indian shit like jewelry and clothes and art,' I said" (23).</li><br>

    <li>"We made powwows because we needed a place to be together. Something intertribal, something old, something to make us money, something we could work toward, for our jewelry, our songs, our dances, our drum. We keep powwowing because there aren't very many places where we get to all be together, where we get to see and hear each other" (135).</li><br>

    <li>"'Powwows are all about flash, aren't they?'" (247).</li><br>

    <li>"She wonders, she has the thought, <i>Did someone really come to get us here? Now?</i> She doesn't know what she means" (278).</li></ul></p><br>
