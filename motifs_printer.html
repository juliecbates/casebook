<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> 3D Printed Guns</h2>
  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30px;">3D printed guns might be one of the more surprising elements of the story, but they are an important element to the development of the plot. Characters responsible for the shooting at the end of the book are able to sneak them past the metal detectors at the powwow. They invite a contemporary element--a new threat from the 21st century--into the story. Ironically, during the Spring 2021 semester, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-guns/biden-looks-into-taking-action-on-3d-printer-guns-imported-firearms-idUSKBN2BI384">President Joe Biden announced a proposed ban on such weapons.</a></p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Notable Instances of 3D Printed Guns in the Novel</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;"><ul style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;">
    <li>Tony Loneman [link character name]
      “What the fuck is that?” I said.<br><br>
      “Plastic,” Octavio said.<br><br>
      “It works?”<br><br>
      “It’s 3-D Printed. You wanna see?” he said.<br><br>
      “See?”<br><br>
      Out in the backyard, I aimed the gun at a can of Pepsi on a string, with two hands, my tongue out and one eye closed.<br><br>
      “You ever fired a gun before?” he said.<br><br>
      “No,” I said.<br><br>
      “Shit’ll make your ears ring.”<br><br>
      “Can I?” I said, and before I got an answer I felt my finger squeeze and then the boom go through me (23-24).</li><br>

    <li>Daniel Gonzalez [link to character]
      “Octavio pulled the gun out of my hands. He looked down the barrel, pointed it at us. That’s when it was my turn to get scared. Octavio holding it made it even more real. Made the white of it creepy--like some plastic message from the future about shit getting into the wrong hands (189).<br><br>

      “So when I first heard about this 3-D printer that could print a version of itself I thought of you and the pit bulls. The idea about the gun came later. I learned to be okay with Octavio. He started talking to me like I wasn’t just your little brother. He asked me if I needed work” (192). </li><br>

    <li>Octavio Gomez [link character page]
      “Even though the guns are plastic, going through the metal detectors still makes Octavio sweat” (256).</li></ul></p><br>
