<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Spiders</h2>
  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30px;">Spider symbolism recurs throughout the novel, having special significance to <a href="characters.html">Opal Bear Shield</a> and <a href="characters.html">Jacquie Red Feather’s</a> family. Their mother, Vicky, taught them Cheyenne stories and lore surrounding spiders that appears to comment on the thematic function of spiders. According to Vicky, spiders represent things that act as both homes and traps, such as alcohol for Jacquie or Indian heritage for Opal. Both Opal and Orvil pull spider legs out of their bodies during their adolescence, also suggesting a correlation between spiders and emergence into adulthood.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Notable Spider Quotations</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;"><ul style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;">
    <li>“Jacquie kneeled in front of the minifridge. In her head she heard her mom say, “The spider's web is a home and a trap.” And even though she never really knew what her mom meant by it, she’d been making it make sense over the years, giving it more meaning than her mom probably ever intended. In this case Jacquie was the spider, and the minifridge was the web. Home was to drink. To drink was the trap. Or something like that. The point was <i> Do not open the fridge </i>. And she didn’t” (101).</li><br>

    <li>“The trickster spider, Veho, her mom used to tell her and Opal about, he was always stealing eyes to see better. Veho was the white man who came and made the old world watch with his eyes” (106).</li><br>

    <li>“Opal and Jacquie’s mom never let them kill a spider if they found one in the house, or anywhere for that matter. Her mom said spiders carry miles of web in their bodies, miles of story, miles of potential home and trap. She said that’s what we are. Home and trap” (163).</li><br>

    <li>“Opal pulled three spider legs out of her leg the Sunday afternoon before she and Jacquie left the home, the house, the man they’d been left with after their mom left this world. There’d recently been blood from her first moon. Both the menstrual blood and the spider legs had made her feel the same kind of shame. Something was in her that came out, that seemed so creaturely, so grotesque yet magical, that the only readily available emotion she had for both occasions was shame, which led to secrecy in both cases” (165).</li></ul></p><br>
