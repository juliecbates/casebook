<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Public Transportation</h2>
  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30px;">Orange uses public transportation a few times throughout the novel.<a href="characters.html">Dene Oxendene</a> uses public transportation and sees his own "tag" of where he's been through his life. But that's not the only reason public transportation is so symbolic in <i>There There</i>. Orange brings up public transportation in the prologue, as a way of separating the stereotypical image of Native Americans from Urbanized Native Americans, telling the difference between what they do now, what they hear now, how they get around now.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive; margin-left: 50px;"> Notable Public Transportation Quotations</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;"><ul style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:30px;">
    <li>"We know the sound of the freeway better than we do rivers, the howl of distant trains better than wolf howls, we know the smell of gas and freshly wet concrete and burned rubber better than we do the smell of cedar or sage or even fry bread [...] We ride buses,, trains, and cars across over, and under concrete plains" (11).</li><br>

    <li>"I would hate it if I got moved outta Oakland, because I know it so well, from West to East to Deep East and back, on bike or bus or BART. It's my only home. I wouldn't make it nowhere else" (18).</li><br>

    <li>"One of the first things Dene learned when he first started taking the bus in Oakland was that you don't stare, you don't even glance, but you don't totally not look either. Out of respect you acknowledge. You look and don't look" (28).</li><br>

    <li>"The train floats alongside the freeway next to cars. Each of their speeds is different: The speed of the cars is short, disconnected, sporadic. Dene and the train slither along the tracks as one movement and speed. There's something cinematic about their variable speeds, like a moment in a movie that makes you feel something for reasons you can't explain" (29).</li></ul></p><br>
